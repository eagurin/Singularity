## Implementation approach

To address the requirements, we will utilize FastAPI for its asynchronous support and scalability, which is crucial for real-time NLP processing. For the database, SQLAlchemy with Alembic for migrations will be used to ensure flexibility and ease of ORM mapping. Pydantic will be employed for data validation and schema definitions. For the NLP functionalities, we will integrate the Spacy library, known for its efficiency and accuracy in natural language processing tasks. The project structure will be modular, separating concerns into distinct layers (API, service, database, models, and utilities) to enhance maintainability and scalability.

## Anything UNCLEAR

The specifics of the NLP models and how they integrate with the system's architecture need clarification. It's assumed that pre-existing models will be used, but the process for updating these models or integrating custom models is not detailed. Further information on the expected volume of data and real-time processing requirements would also help in selecting the appropriate database and optimizing the system's performance.
