{"summary":"---\n## instruction:\nThe test file `test_alembic/env.py` is empty and does not contain any test cases to validate the functionality of the development code in `alembic/env.py`. To correct this, you should implement test cases that verify the behavior of both `run_migrations_offline` and `run_migrations_online` functions under various conditions. Ensure that the tests cover scenarios such as successful migrations, handling of exceptions, and correct configuration of the Alembic context. Use a testing framework like pytest for structuring your tests and mocking external dependencies such as the database connection.\n## File To Rewrite:\ntest_alembic/env.py\n## Status:\nFAIL\n## Send To:\nQaEngineer\n---","stdout":"","stderr":""}
