SQLAlchemy is used for ORM, and Alembic for database migrations. Pydantic is employed for data validation. New libraries such as TextBlob, spaCy, and Transformers are integrated for NLP tasks. Docker and Kubernetes are used for scaling, with Redis for caching and RabbitMQ for asynchronous task execution.","Anything UNCLEAR":"The process for integrating real-time updates into the dashboard using WebSockets needs further exploration. Additionally, the specifics of scaling the system with Kubernetes, including the setup of auto-scaling policies and resource limits, require clarification."}
