SQLAlchemy is used for ORM, and Alembic for database migrations. Pydantic is employed for data validation.","Anything UNCLEAR":"The specifics of the NLP models and how they integrate with the system's architecture need clarification. It's assumed that pre-existing models will be used, but the process for updating these models or integrating custom models is not detailed. Further information on the expected volume of data and real-time processing requirements would also help in selecting the appropriate database and optimizing the system's performance."}
